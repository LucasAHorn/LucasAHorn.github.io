This is a personal website project

I plan to use this website to:
 - relearn some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
 - host games that I develop (can I host games in c or java on this page?)
    - tic tac toe
    - connect 4
    - chess maybe
    - checkers
 - create a div to hold games
 - replace the games with a screen when clicked (have a return to games button)
 - possibly also convert spotify playlists to youtube music playlists and vice versa
 - host my resume

plan on making the website to be top to bottom:
 - Header 
     - Name
     - year(freshman) | major(software Eng)
 - resume
 - games (still need to develop)
 
CURRENT ISSUES WITH WEBSITE:
 - none that I am aware of

Features to add
 - games (in java, c, or js)
 - nav bar
 - better color scheme and ideas
