This is a personal website project

I plan to use this website to:
 - relearn some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
 - host games that I develop 
    - tic tac toe
    - connect 4
    - chess maybe
    - checkers
 - possibly also convert spotify playlists to youtube music playlists and vice versa
 - host my resume

Currently trying to impliment a time function to use elsewhere
